In economics we attempt to explain outcomes on the basis of agents acting in a rational manner.  We do not actually believe that all agents *are* rational, but we typically treat them *as if* they all are.  An analogy might be helpful.  A neoclassical economist would model an expert billiards player by assuming that they have a PhD in physics.

Such a model would do a great job of predicting play, even though no expert billiards players have a PhD in physics. Billiards players become expert by constantly practicing billiards... which precludes them from getting their PhD in physics. What I am trying to get at here is a model is useful if it predicts behaviour accurately, regardless of its assumptions. 

Experiment 0 is a test of rationality. You were asked to choose a number between 0 and 100 inclusive. You were told that the *target* was going to be $\frac23$ times the average choice within the class, and whoever chose the number closest to the target would win \$20. Presumably you like money, and \$20 is enough for you to think briefly about what choice would make it more likely you would win... What is the largest number you could choose? Thus, what is the highest possible *average* choice? What would the target be in that case? ...So 67 would *always* be a better choice than 68 or above because $\frac23\times$ average(choice) will *always* be lower than 66.66.  Here are the results:

```{r first_chunk}

This is not to say that *all* of economics is based on the assumption of rationality.  There is an entire field of economics (behavioural economics) devoted to cataloging the systematic differences we see between human decision making and that of a perfectly rational agent. The goal of environmental policy is to alter behaviour in a way to reduce damages to the environment.  Taking into account these irrationalities *can* lead to better policy outcomes.
